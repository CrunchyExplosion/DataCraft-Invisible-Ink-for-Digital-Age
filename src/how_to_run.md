# Data Encoding and Decoding Flow

This project demonstrates the process of encoding a zip file into a PNG image and then decoding it back to the original zip file. The flow involves the following steps:

1. Takes an input zip file and converts it to a bin file containing its binary data.
2. Converts the bin file to a PNG image that contains the data.
3. Converts the PNG image back to bin data.
4. Reconstructs the zip file from the bin data.

The file formats used in the code are as follows:

- **input.zip** -> **bin_data_of_zip.bin** -> **output.png** -> **output_bin_data.bin** -> **zip_reconstructed.zip**
